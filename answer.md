7. **Decode the following JWT and explain its contents:**
   - Token: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJqb2huLmRvZUBleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsInJvbGUiOiJBRE1JTiIsInVzZXJfaWQiOiJjZGY4M2QzZi0zNzQ5LTRjZGQtOTRlYS1hNTVjZmMwNDhkMGYiLCJleHAiOjE3MTc2MTY4MjAuMjIwNzA5fQ.ANS8PgUiwPCmOvnZLYTCy_5WzLyhCDOx8aF4xu-Kaz8`
   - Use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to decode and explain the contents.

8. **Describe the user registration logic in your project. Provide a pseudo-code workflow from the registration request to storing the user in the database.**

9. **Detail the steps involved in the user email verification process. Provide a pseudo-code workflow from sending a verification email to activating the user's account.**

## Security Practices

10. **How do you ensure the security of user passwords in your project? Discuss the hashing algorithm used and any additional security measures implemented.**

11. **Explain the difference between hashing and encoding. Provide examples from your project where each is used:**
    - **Hashing:** Example and explanation with code
    - **Encoding:** Example and explanation with code

15. **What is HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)? Provide an example of its implementation in your project's API responses, along with a screenshot.**

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

16. **What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and how is it implemented in your project?**

17. **Explain the different user roles defined in your project (ANONYMOUS, AUTHENTICATED, MANAGER, ADMIN) and their permissions.**

18. **Provide a code example showing how RBAC is enforced in one of your FastAPI endpoints.**

## Route Parameters and Pydantic Schemas

19. **Explain how route parameters are used in FastAPI. Provide an example of a route that takes a parameter and demonstrate how it is used within the endpoint.**

20. **How does FastAPI use Pydantic schemas to generate Swagger documentation? Provide an example from your project where a Pydantic schema is used and show the corresponding Swagger documentation.**
